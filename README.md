# Todo list app 2

Whenever I want to learn a new technology/technique/thing, I often use that to build a new todo list app as a test/case study.

The humble todo list app has become a bit of a joke or clich√© in the dev community, but by building the same simple functionality each time, I don't need to think too much about the form or functionality, so I'm freed up to focus on the implementation instead.
